# Intel Edison Hackday

This repository holds all the information for the [http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/intel-edison-demo-day-tickets-13546962329](Intel Edison Demo Day) run by [http://designswarm.com/](designswarm), Intel&reg; Corporation and [http://www.mcqn.com](MCQN Ltd) on November 28th.

It collects together all the code, etc. that we'll be using on the day and includes the steps that we'll be running through as we explore the Edison board.

FIXME Explain the different folders, etc.

## Respository contents

  * Arduino: Example code
  * Downloads: Arduino programming environment for Edison, relevant drivers, etc.

## Getting set up

 1. If you haven't already, download the [](zip file of all the things you'll need) FIXME  Once it's downloaded, unzip it (it doesn't matter where to, but somewhere you can find it again - for example, to your Desktop)
 1. While that downloads we'll unbox the goodies.
 1. Next we'll follow the steps to connect your Edison board and install the software.
    Follow the relevant link for your operating system:
   * [https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23147](Windows)
   * [https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23148](Mac)
   * [https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23149](Linux)

    Your Edison boards have already been flashed with the latest image, so you don't need to worry about that.

FIXME John, do we need any drivers for Mac?
FIXME John, does the Mac come with ability to open zip files by default?
